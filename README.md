# java-spline-interpolation

Java application to draw spline interpolation between given points, written during my Numerical Methods II classes at military University of Technology.

I presents a plot of base points and interpolation splines. 

I didn't write any Java code lately and I don't have any build scripts for this code anymore, but it should work when imported to regular Java IDE.

Needed libraries are included in *lib* directory.
